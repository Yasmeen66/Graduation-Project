 To read a news article from the BBC together so you can improve your English vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation so you feel more confident speaking. Welcome back to J4's English. Of course, I'm Jennifer now. Let's get started. First, I'll read the headline. People want dumb phones. Will companies make them? Now, notice there is a single dash around dumb phones because it's laying you know it's not the technical term dumb phones. So here you see in the image a dumb phone also previously called a flip phone. What about you? Do you want a dumb phone? Because the headline says people and of course you're a person so do you want a dumb phone? You can say yes, yes I do is the short form or you can use the full form and say yes I want and then instead of repeating a dumb phone the noun, neither speakers we use the word one. Yes, I want one and one represents dumb phones so that's an easy way to sound or fluent by not repeating the noun. Or negatively no no I don't notice that contraction of do not no I don't no I don't want one I don't want one. So put your option in the comments you can just put yes or no you don't need to use it but if you want you can use the short or full form as well and let's see if the headline is right and if people want dumb phones so we'll find out in the comments and don't worry about taking notes because I summarize everything in a free lesson PDF you can find the link in the description.
